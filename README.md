# The Impact of AI-Based Modeling on the Accuracy of Protein Assembly Prediction: Insights from CASP15

In CASP15, 87 predictors submitted around 11,000 models on 41 assembly targets. The community demonstrated exceptional performance in overall fold and interface contact prediction, achieving an impressive success rate of 90% (compared to 31% in CASP14). This remarkable accomplishment is largely due to the incorporation of DeepMindâ€™s AF2-Multimer approach into custom-built prediction pipelines. To evaluate the added value of participating methods, we compared the community models to the baseline AF2-Multimer predictor. In over 1/3 of cases the community models were superior to the baseline predictor. The main reasons for this improved performance were the use of custom-built multiple sequence alignments, optimized AF2-Multimer sampling, and the manual assembly of AF2-Multimer-built subcomplexes. The best three groups, in order, are Zheng, Venclovas and Wallner. Zheng and Venclovas reached a 73.2% success rate over all (41) cases, while Wallner attained 69.4% success rate over 36 cases. Nonetheless, challenges remain in predicting structures with weak evolutionary signals, such as nanobody-antigen, antibody-antigen, and viral complexes. Expectedly, modeling large complexes remains also challenging due to their high memory compute demands.
In addition to the assembly category, we assessed the accuracy of modeling interdomain interfaces in the tertiary structure prediction targets. Models on seven targets featuring 17 unique interfaces were analyzed. Best predictors achieved the 76.5% success rate, with the UM-TBM group being the leader. In the interdomain category, we observed that the predictors faced challenges, as in the case of the assembly category, when the evolutionary signal for a given domain pair was weak or the structure was large. Overall, CASP15 witnessed unprecedented improvement in interface modeling, reflecting the AI revolution seen in CASP14.

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for "The Impact of AI-Based Modeling on the Accuracy of Protein Assembly Prediction: Insights from CASP15." This repository contains the data and analysis scripts used to reproduce the figures and analysis presented in the paper titled "The Impact of AI-Based Modeling on the Accuracy of Protein Assembly Prediction: Insights from CASP15."

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

1. **Scripts**: This folder contains the Python scripts used for processing CASP15 score files and generating plots. Specifically, there are two Jupyter Notebook scripts:

   - [CASP15_Assembly_Analysis_Script.ipynb](scripts/CASP15_Assembly_Analysis_Script.ipynb): This script is used for the analysis of CASP15 assembly results.
   
   - [CASP15_Interdomain_Analysis_Script.ipynb](scripts/CASP15_Interdomain_Analysis_Script.ipynb): This script is used for the analysis of CASP15 interdomain results.

2. **Scorefiles**: In this folder, you will find the CASP15 result files that serve as input for the analysis scripts. The score files are organized into subfolders for the assembly and interdomain categories.

3. **Outputfiles**: This folder contains the output plots generated by the analysis scripts. The generated plots are also categorized into subfolders for assembly and interdomain analysis.
